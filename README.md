# Genomer
This program will use a data file containing DNA and will predicted gene sequences based on the training set. It will then compare the predicted sequences to the testing set to see the accuracy of the model. This project uses multiple libraries, but focuses on the sklearn library (sci-kit learn), which is useful for machine learning. We also used pandas to organize our data and Biopython to read our data files.
