# Genomer
This program will use a complete human genome as a training set. It will then predict the translational product that will be created when given an unlabeled DNA sequences. This project uses the sklearn library from Python in order to train our model to a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier. It will then predict the labels of the given DNA sequences and then compare those labels to the actual labels from the testing set.

pip install biopython

pip install sklearn

pip install pandas

In order to use this program, make sure to have all the data files in one directory. Then, go into your command line (if you're on a Windows system), navigate to the correct directory using "cd", and then type:

python filename.py
  
in order to run the program.
