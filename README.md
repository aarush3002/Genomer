# Genomer
This program will use a data file containing DNA and will predict gene sequences based on the training set. It will then compare the predicted sequences to the testing set to see the accuracy of the model. This project uses multiple libraries, but focuses on the sklearn library (sci-kit learn), which is useful for machine learning. We also used pandas to organize our data and Biopython to read our data files. You will need to install Python 3.7 to run this program. You must also install the libraries with the following commands (enter in cmd):

pip install biopython

pip install sklearn

pip install pandas

In order to use this program, make sure to have all the data files in one directory. Then, go into your command line (if you're on a Windows system), navigate to the correct directory using "cd", and then type:

python filename.py
  
in order to run the program.
